## Terraform Error-1: `Error acquiring the state lock`

### What Does This Mean?

Terraform couldn’t obtain a lock on the remote state file (commonly in S3 with a DynamoDB lock table). This lock prevents simultaneous operations on your infrastructure.

---

### Why Did This Happen?

- Manual interruption of a `terraform plan` (e.g., Ctrl+C).
- The DynamoDB state lock wasn’t released, blocking future commands.

---

### How to Fix

Release the lock with:

```bash
terraform force-unlock <lock-id>
```

Only use this after confirming no other Terraform operation is running.

---

### Other Common Causes

- CI/CD job fails during `plan` or `apply`.
- Terminal closed before Terraform finished.
- Multiple users run Terraform at the same time.
- Network issues while updating the state file.

---

### Best Practices

- Avoid interrupting Terraform runs.
- Pull the latest code before running any plan.
- Use CI/CD pipelines for applies; avoid manual applies in production.
- Enable state lock protection (DynamoDB).
- Monitor the lock table for stuck locks.
- Set up CI alerts for failed jobs.

---

### Risks

- Corrupted `.tfstate` file.
- Accidental resource deletion or overwrites.
- Team conflicts.
- Infrastructure drift or downtime.
